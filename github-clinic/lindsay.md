### Mills Team - Gulf of Maine Research Institute

I am a participant in the Openscapes FDD Cohort. I am a quantitative research associate at [Gulf of Maine Research Institute](https://gmri.org/) where I work in the [Integrated Systems Ecology Lab](https://gmri.org/commitments/science/integrated-systems-ecology/) with [Dr. Kathy Mills](https://gmri.org/our-approach/staff/kathy-mills/).

I've been working on some exciting projects while at GMRI, including:

1. Trends in growth and survival of Carlin-tagged Atlantic salmon
2. Evaluating community adaptive capacity to shifting species distributions based on commercial reliance, emerging species, and socio-economic indicators
3. Methods to evaluate leading and trailing edges of species distributions
