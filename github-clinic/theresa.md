# About Me

I'm finishing my PhD in the Joint Doctoral Program in Ecology at UC Davis and San Diego State University and am working on a postdoc with Josh Stoll at the University of Maine. I just returned from a month of field work in Maine - it was so lovely!

## When I have free time

I like spending time outside and with my family. My favorite things to do are 

* make ice cream
* take my puppy to the beach
* knit hats for a winter that never comes to Monterey Bay, where I live

### I'm so glad to be in this community with you all! :)
