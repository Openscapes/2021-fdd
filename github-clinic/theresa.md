# The power of open science: publishing with GitHub

## Hi, I'm Theresa Burnham :)

I have a few non-science hobbies - 

1. making ice cream (*my best flavor so far is garden mint*)
2. knitting
3. gardening with my partner

And my research is detailed on my [website](www.theresaluburnham.com). I also use [twitter](www.twitter.com/CALobsterLady) to talk shop, but I tend to include other things I'm interested in as well, like politics and memes. 

## This month, I've been doing field work in Maine. Here's a picture from Bailey Island, in Harpswell, Maine.
